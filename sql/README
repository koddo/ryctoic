locale
================

-- locale is set to C
-- we can use collations later, when needed
------------------------------
-- debian docker image doesn't have locales other that utf-8, here is how to add one
-- this worked:
-- # localedef --no-archive -f UTF-8 -i fr_FR fr_FR.UTF-8
-- psql> CREATE COLLATION "fr_FR" (LOCALE = 'fr_FR.utf8');
-- psql> select * from pg_collation;
-- psql> select initcap('welcome to CHAMPS-ÉLYSÉES' collate "fr_FR");
-- => Welcome To Champs-Élysées'
-- by psql I mean pgagmin3, because my terminal couldn't paste those french chars
-- probably it's a good idea to have a copy of this collation named "fr_FR.utf8", I don't know yet, but why anyway?
------------------------------
-- this is meant to be an equivalent to localedef, but didn't work for me:
-- echo "en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen
-- echo "fr_FR.UTF-8 UTF-8" >> /etc/locale.gen
-- locale-gen --no-archive





create role noinherit vs inherit
=======================================

inherit is the default for backwards compatibility
behavior specified by the SQL standard (most closely approximated): noinherit for users, inherit for groups
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createrole.html

we created our clients with inherit for simplicity
to avoid setting role explicitly on login

but administrator is still noinherit
